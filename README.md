## About Amroute
Amroute is a project I developed for CS3200 Database Design at Northeastern University.
It is a database and front facing application for keeping track of the Amtrak train routes
in the US. It supports CRUD operations and basic search functionality. My goal with this project
was not only to learn database design but to also become familiar with some Java web development,
something that has intimidated me in the past.

Another reason I chose this project:
